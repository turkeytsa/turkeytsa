<h2 style="float:right;font-size:3em;color:#ff751a;text-decoration: underline;padding-top:56px" >WHAT IS AUGMENTED REALITY?</h2>

<p  style="float:right;text-align:right;font-size:120%;">Augmented reality is the ability to insert an overlay with digital and virtual information into the real world.
Unlike virtual reality, which creates a totally artificial environment, augmented reality uses the existing environment and overlays new information on top of it. <br><a href="#myDiv2" id="myButton2" style="z-index:900;bottom:20px"><img src="/img/Scroll-Down.png" height="42" width="42"></a><span><span></p></div>

<p style="font-size:120%;margin-bottom:0">

Augmented Reality can be seen through a wide variety of displays, from screens and monitors, to handheld devices or glasses. <br>

<strong>Head mounted displays</strong>, like glasses and lenses, offer the widest visual field and provide more life-like Augmented Reality experiences. 

 <strong>Google Glass </strong>is one of the most common examples of head mounted displays. Unfortunately its production was stopped because of privacy and safety concerns. <a href="#myDiv3" id="myButton3" style="color:#ff6600" >(Skip to safety problems) </a> 

The next step up from glasses is <strong>contact lenses</strong>. It is aimed to eliminate the need for pesky headwear. They are still being developed, specifically for use in the military. <a href="#myDiv4" id="myButton4" style="color:#ff6600" >(Skip to future uses) </a> 

 <br>

Augmented Reality acts as a window in mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. 

Through the viewer users can work with 3D models, view holograms or display information by using their camera. 
<br>

<strong>Head-up displays </strong>are also an augmented reality technology. A transparent display is positioned directly in the drivers’ or pilots’ view without requiring the user to look away from their usual viewpoints to get the data they need.

<p style="font-size:120%;margin-bottom:0">Augmented reality can be used for ill purposes. For instance, hackers may trick users by using their location data and misdirect them by creating fake road signs. 

There are also concerns of privacy. Face-recognition technology improves fast and will allow us to view information about  people we see, such as their social media profiles. Although people willingly put information online, they may want to keep it anonymous.

Furthermore, there are also psychical security concerns. The usage of wearable devices like contact lenses may pose danger because of the possibility of being hacked.

<h1 style="font-size:3em;color:#ff1a1a">Potential Future Uses</h1>
<p style="font-size:120%;margin-bottom:300px">

Augmented reality has a huge potential to affect and be utilized in many industries, from advertising and marketing, to gaming and medicine.<br>

In the future, we will be able to receive more efficient medical care. Augmented Reality applications will help surgeons during surgeries and we will have medical applications, which analyzes our vitals and gather our medical data. For example, <a href="https://clinicloud.com/" style="color:#ff6600" target="_blank">CliniCloud</a>, an Australian startup, made the world’s first stethoscope for home use. As technology continues to advance, we will see more medical applications of augmented reality. Also current technologies like True 3D will develop and give us more accurate information over time.
<br>
Augmented reality also has an important place in online-shopping. For example, an augmented reality app that gives users a map of the store could be launched or shoppers could virtually display products in real world, so that they could be sure that they fit their needs before purchasing.
<br>
The next generation of augmented reality is <strong>Articulated Naturality Web (ANW) </strong>which is introduced by <strong>QderoPateo Communications </strong>. It is described as a<cite> "complete renaissance in the way we approach technology,”</cite> Information is going to be more integrated into the natural world rather than just remaining as an overlay. Furthermore ANW will make it possible to get weather forecast just by holding up mobile devices to the sky. ANW will also be used in tourism in that it will let travelers take a look inside the hotel room by looking at the hotel from the outside. In addition to that, ANW will let customers try furniture in homes and offices before buying them.
