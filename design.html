Unlike virtual reality, which creates a totally artificial environment, augmented reality uses the existing environment and overlays new information on top of it. Augmented Reality has a lot of applications.</div>

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p >By viewing augmented models on their own devices, the students can gain a 
better understanding
of 
the concepts they are studying. 
They can learn the details of historical events through computer 
generated simulations and explore the human anatomy in three dim
esions.
Although there are some educational apps in 2017, it is not broadly used</p>

          <h2>Travelling</h2>
          <p>Augmented reality provides an easy access to information.  Using augmented reality apps, tourists can 
check the weather, find the most suitable hotel,  get info about local establishments at a particular 
location.
Usin
g a smartphone equipped with a camera, tourists can walk through historic places and see facts and 
figures presented as an overlay on their live screen.
Also it is possible with augmented reality apps to translate printed materials such as signs and menus 
in 
to users native language through scanning.</p>

<p style="font-size:120%">Augmented reality can be used for bad purposes. For example, hackers may trick users by using their  location data and pull them into a place by creating fake signs. 

There are also privacy concerns. Face-recognition technology improves really fast and 
will allow us to view information about  people we see like their social media profiles. Although people willingly put information online, they may not want everyone to know about their lives and background.

Furthermore, there are also some psychical security concerns. People will use wearable devices like lenses, which may cause danger because of the possibility of being hacked by bad-aimed people.
