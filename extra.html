<h3>Numune-i Terakki</h3>
<p>Numune-i Terakki is Istanbul Lisesi’s seasonally published science magazine prepared by students and alumni. First published in 1887, it was the first student magazine in Ottoman Empire. Meaning “instance of development” originally, Numune-i Terakki is also the very first name of our school. Thanks to the founder of our school, mathematician Mehmet Nadir Bey, the magazine had a very good academic level from the beginning, and at that time the articles and problems that were published were interesting for both primary and high school students. The publication stopped in 1888, but in 2009 students took action to publish the magazine again. In June 2010, they managed to bring Numune-i Terakki back to publication again. Numune-i Terakki is also the name of the Science Week comitee of Istanbul Lisesi. Every year in January, the comitee arranges a week-long science and technology event for both students of Istanbul Lisesi and students from other high schools. They also organize trivia contests about biology, maths, chemistry and physics. Experiment displays are also a part of science week. Visitors can make experiments under the supervision of comitee members.

<h3>Science Olympiad</h3>
<p>Students interested in science have the chance to participate in the Science Olympiad organized by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK). This way, TUBITAK can identify scientifically gifted children and encourage them to develop their talents. The National Science Olympiad has been organized since 1993 in 5 subjects: math, biology, chemistry, physics and computer science. Istanbul Lisesi takes part in the math, biology and computer olympiad competitions and has achieved great successes. </p>
