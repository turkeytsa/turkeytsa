<h3>Numune-i Terakki</h3>
<p>Numune-i Terakki is Istanbul Lisesi’s seasonal published science magazine prepared by the students and alumni. First published in 1887, it was the first student magazine in Ottoman Empire. Meaning “instance of development” originally, Numune-i Terakki is also the very first name of our school. Thanks to the founder of our school, mathematician Mehmet Nadir Bey, the magazine had a very good academic level from the beginning, and at that time articles and problems that were interesting for both primary and high school students were published. The publication stopped in 1888, but in 2009 students took steps to publish the magazine again. In June 2010, they managed to bring Numune-i Terakki to its publication life again. Numune-i Terakki is also the name of the science comitee of Istanbul Lisesi. Every year in January, the comitee arranges a week for both students of Istanbul Lisesi and students from other high schools, which are interested in science and technology. They also organize  	knowledge contest about biology, maths, chemistry and physics. Experiment exhibitons are also a part of science week. Visitors can make experiments with members of the comitee.
