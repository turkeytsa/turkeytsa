The Technology Student Association (TSA) is a non-profit organization for middle and high school students interested in technology.

TSA's membership includes over 150,000 middle and high school students in more than 2,000 schools. TSA is supported by educators, parents and business leaders, who believe in the need for a technologically literate society. Members learn through exciting competitive events, leadership opportunities and much more.

TSA provides rules and guidelines to its student members and advisors for thirty-two middle school level and thirty-three high school level competitive events. Competitions feature: problems in communications, design and engineering, environmental systems, manufacturing/construction, and transportation. In both team and individual events, students are challenged to use and improve their skills in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) areas.
