<p>In Turkey, celiac disease is not known and thus, the products are expensive. We have a teammate, who is suffering from celiac disease. Therefore, in order to collect donations for the ones, who are not able to afford these products, we had run in Istanbul Marathon, in order to create an awareness. With the collected charity, we bought some gluten-free products for little children. Furthermore, we also teach English to the Syrian refugees in a primary school in Istanbul.</p>
