<strong>Running for Celiac Awareness</strong><br>
<br>
In Turkey, celiac disease is not widely recognized and thus, gluten-free products are expensive. In our chapter we have a teammate who is suffering from celiac disease. In order to collect donations for the ones who are not able to afford these products, we ran in Istanbul Marathon to create awareness. With the collected charity, we bought gluten-free products for children suffering from the disease.
