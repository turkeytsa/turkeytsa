<blockquote ><h1 style="text-align:left;">Our Motto</h1><p>Learning to Lead in a Technical World </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h1 style="text-align:left;">Our Creed</h1><p>I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my nation.

<blockquote ><h1 style="text-align:left;">Our Mission</h1><p>TSA Turkey is the only chapter to attend the National TSA Conference from Turkey. Therefore we do not have only a national but also an international mission to fulfill. 
Within our country, we aspire to provide as many people as possible access to technology education since our curriculum does not include it. 
At the TSA Conference, we are responsible for representing not only our school but also our country.
In general, we place technology in our focus and bring it on in every aspect of science while allowing students to strengthen their leadership skills and to explore the latest innovations at the first hand.</p></blockquote>
